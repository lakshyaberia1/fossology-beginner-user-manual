# Deep and Practical Uses of FOSSology

This document explains how FOSSology is used in real-world scenarios
after basic installation, upload, scanning, and troubleshooting
are understood.

This section is intended for users who already know
how to run basic scans.

## Why Deep Usage Matters

FOSSology is not only a scanning tool.
It is a compliance decision-support system.

Organizations use FOSSology to:
- Reduce legal risk
- Prepare license compliance reports
- Review open-source usage before product release
- Support audits and due diligence

---

## Typical Real-World Workflow

A common workflow in companies looks like this:

1. Upload source code
2. Run multiple scanning agents
3. Review detected licenses
4. Manually verify unclear results
5. Export reports
6. Make compliance decisions

FOSSology supports this entire workflow.

## Using FOSSology for Open-Source Compliance

Companies use FOSSology to:
- Identify licenses in third-party code
- Detect incompatible license combinations
- Ensure license obligations are met

Example:
- GPL code inside a proprietary product
- Missing copyright notices
- Unknown license texts

FOSSology highlights these risks early.

---

## Manual Review and Decision Making

Not all results are automatic.

Some licenses require:
- Human verification
- Legal interpretation
- Policy decisions

FOSSology helps by:
- Showing file-level license matches
- Highlighting confidence levels
- Grouping results logically

Final decisions are always made by humans.

---

## Using Multiple Agents Together

Best practice is to use multiple agents:

- Nomos for fast license detection
- Monk for deeper matching
- Copyright agent for ownership data

Combining agents improves accuracy.

---

## Organizing Large Projects

For large codebases:
- Use folders to separate projects
- Name uploads clearly
- Keep scan history

This helps track:
- Changes over time
- License evolution
- Regression issues

---

## Continuous Usage Pattern

In many teams, FOSSology is used repeatedly:

- Scan code during development
- Scan again before release
- Compare results between versions

This helps detect new license risks early.

---

## Reporting and Audits

FOSSology is often used to support:
- Internal audits
- Customer compliance requests
- Legal reviews

Reports generated from FOSSology provide:
- Transparency
- Traceability
- Evidence of due diligence

---

## What FOSSology Is Not

Important limitations:

- It is not a legal advisor
- It does not replace legal review
- It does not fix license problems automatically

FOSSology provides information.
Decisions are made by users.

---

## Best Practices

- Scan early, not at release time
- Re-scan after major code changes
- Combine automated and manual review
- Keep historical scan data

---

## Summary

FOSSology is most powerful when used as:
- A continuous compliance tool
- A review platform, not just a scanner
- A support system for informed decisions

Understanding deep usage unlocks the full value of FOSSology.
